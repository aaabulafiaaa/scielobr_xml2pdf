ScieloBR XML to PDF

A PHP implementation of Scielo's brazilian XML standard (http://docs.scielo.org/projects/scielo-publishing-schema/pt_BR/latest/) using simplexml and fpdf to output pdfs. The general purpose of this project is generate pdf files from XML, so that there's no need (or at least there's a minimal need) to check manually the output files for whole issues or individual articles. This is being thought as an independent server application, although it wouldn't be any difficult to implement it as an OJS plugin so that the pdf generation would happen as a new issue (with marked XML files through Scielo Brazil's tool, Markup) is published.

Unfortunately I'll have to use PHP's "OO" to implement this sice it'd be easier to implement fpdf to it and organize; i'm simply translating Scielo schema into PHP to be able to handle those files; an issue i found is that many indexed journals do not follow scielo's standards, so that's a deal breaker, but i'll do it following the documentation and see where it leads me; organizing the article in a class will give me the ability to change how the file is parsed (ie different tags) so i wouldn't be the only person capable of using it without reading the whole specs.
